Machinelearning internship tasks

Task 1A - Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm Using ML Fundamentals
i) Decision Tree Algorithm
This program demonstrates the working of the Decision Tree algorithm, a powerful and interpretable machine learning method used for classification and regression tasks. The decision tree algorithm splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions. The implementation will cover:

The construction of the decision tree from the given dataset.
The process of making predictions using the constructed decision tree.
Visualization of the decision tree for better interpretability.


ii) Back Propagation Algorithm
The back propagation algorithm is a fundamental method used for training artificial neural networks. This program will implement the back propagation algorithm and test it using appropriate datasets. The implementation includes:

Forward pass: Calculating the output of the neural network.
Backward pass: Computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, known as back propagation.
Updating the weights to minimize the loss function.


Task 1B - Naïve Bayesian Classifier for Text Classification
This task involves using the Naïve Bayesian classifier model to classify a set of documents. The Naïve Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors. This program will:

Preprocess the text data (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming).
Train a Naïve Bayes classifier on the training data.
Classify the test documents and calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.


Phase II - Task 2: Rapido Bike Ride Request Forecast using ML
In this task, we aim to predict the number of bike ride requests for a particular hour using machine learning. This involves:

Data collection and preprocessing: Gathering historical data on bike ride requests, weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant features.
Feature engineering: Creating new features that might help improve the predictive power of the model.
Model training and evaluation: Training various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict the number of ride requests and evaluating their performance using metrics such as mean squared error and R² score.
Model selection and tuning: Selecting the best-performing model and tuning its hyperparameters to optimize performance



Phase III Task 3
Health information needs are also changing the information seeking behavior and can be observed around the globe. Challenges faced by many people are looking online for health information regarding diseases, diagnoses and different treatments. If a recommendation system can be made for doctors and medicine while using review mining will save a lot of time. In this type of system, the user face problem in understanding the heterogeneous medical vocabulary as the users are laymen. User is confused because a large amount of medical information on different mediums are available.The idea behind recommender system is to adapt to cope with the special requirements of the health domain related with users.
